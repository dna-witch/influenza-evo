Understanding how viral populations evolve is crucial to understanding the epidemiology of viral diseases as well as to designing successful antiviral treatments. RNA viruses mutate at high frequencies over short replication periods, quickly acquiring antiviral drug resistance. This project focuses on identifying quantitative parameters that drive selection in inter-host viral evolution and computationally predicting the values of these parameters. Viral population genomes will be collected from various times and compared to an original population using Hidden Markov Models. The goal is to be able to model viral sequence evolution, selective pressures, and get insights into virulence, pathogenicity, and environmental stability.
