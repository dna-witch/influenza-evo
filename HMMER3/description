## Why am I using profile-HMMs?
Good question! (will answer in detail later)

All profile-HMM data sources, descriptions, files, and databases will be listed below:

## For HPIV Type 4 Viruses
+ hpiv4Asia.hmm
  + Data type: Genome
  + used sequences downloaded from ViPR database
  + built using HMMER3
  + number of sequences used in build: 77
  + HPIV Type 4 strains from Asia; not all complete genomes; mixed host species; collection dates not specified
  + notes: 

+ hpiv4NorthAmerica.hmm
  + Data type: Genome
  + used sequences downloaded from ViPR database
  + built using HMMER3
  + number of sequences used in build: 45
  + HPIV Type 4 strains from North America; not all complete genomes; mixed host species; collection dates not specified
  + notes: 
  
+ hpiv4SouthAmerica.hmm
  + Data type: Genome
  + used sequences downloaded from ViPR database
  + built using HMMER3
  + number of sequences used in build: 3
  + HPIV Type 4 strains from South America; not all complete genomes; mixed host species; collection dates not specified
  + notes: Sample size is very small! Could skew the results.
  
+ hpiv4Oceania.hmm
  + Data type: Genome
  + used sequences downloaded from ViPR database
  + built using HMMER3
  + number of sequences used in build: 13
  + HPIV Type 4 strains from Oceania; not all complete genomes; mixed host species; collection dates not specified
  + notes: Sample size is very small! Could skew the results.
